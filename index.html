          <h1>2011–12 season: Rookie of the Year</h1>
          <p>Irving announced that he would forgo his final three seasons of
             eligibility and enter the 2011 NBA draft, where he was selected
             with the first overall pick by the Cleveland Cavaliers. Irving was
             named to the 2012 Rising Stars Challenge, where he played for Team
             Chuck. Irving scored 34 points in the game, going 8-of-8 from
             three-point range, and earned MVP honors. He also won the 2012 NBA
             Rookie of the Year Award with 117 of a possible 120 first-place
             votes. He was the only unanimous selection to the NBA All-Rookie
             First Team. For the season, Irving averaged 18.5 points, 5.4 assists
             and shot 46.9% from the field, including 39.9% on
             three-pointers.</p>

          <h1>2013–14 season: All-Star Game MVP</h1>
          <p>Fans chose Irving to be the starting point guard for the Eastern
            Conference in the 2014 NBA All-Star game. He was the All-Star game MVP
            , recording 31 points and 14 assists as the East beat the West
            163-155. On February 28, 2014, Irving recorded his first career
            triple-double with 21 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds in a
            99-79 win over the Utah Jazz. This was also the Cavaliers' first
            triple-double since March 16, 2010. On April 5, 2014, Irving recorded
            a then career-high 44 points in a 96–94 overtime loss to the
            Charlotte Bobcats.</p>

          <h1>2014–15 season: Big Three formation and first NBA Finals</h1>
          <p>On July 10, 2014, Irving signed a five-year, $90 million contract
            extension with the Cavaliers. His contract extension came in the
            wake of LeBron James's return to Cleveland and Kevin Love's trade
            request from Minnesota, as the trio teamed up to start a new "Big
            Three" in Cleveland. After a shaky start to the season, in which
            they fell to a record of 5-7 after a November 22 loss to Toronto,
            the Cavaliers went on an eight-game winning streak during which
            Irving averaged 19.3 points per game, including a 37-point game
            against the New York Knicks on December 4.</p>
